# **Literature-Survey-on-Metaphor-and-Idiom-Detection-in-Large-Language-Models**  

This repository presents a comprehensive literature survey on the advancements in metaphor and idiom detection using large language models (LLMs) such as BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT. It includes an analysis of cutting-edge methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics that demonstrate the progress and challenges in this domain.  

## **Overview**  
Figurative language, including metaphors and idioms, plays a crucial role in human communication, enriching it with creativity and depth. The increasing integration of LLMs into NLP tasks has led to notable advancements in understanding and detecting these complex expressions. This project provides insights into recent research, focusing on the performance of state-of-the-art models and datasets.

## **Key Topics Covered**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **FLUTE**: Figurative language understanding and textual explanations.  
  - **MUNCH**: Multilingual and culturally nuanced figurative language datasets.  
  - **NewsMet**: Dataset focusing on metaphor detection in news articles.  

- **Models**:  
  - **MelBERT**: Combines metaphor identification theories with BERT embeddings.  
  - **IlliniMet**: Integrates RoBERTa embeddings and linguistic features.  
  - **Go Figure!**: Multi-task transformer-based architecture for metaphor and idiom detection.  
  - **Other LLMs**: Evaluation of BERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA for metaphor detection across datasets.  

- **Methodologies**:  
  - Multi-task learning approaches for handling metaphors and idioms.  
  - Integration of pre-trained LLM embeddings with linguistic theories (e.g., MIP, SPV).  
  - Performance evaluation across multilingual and low-resource settings.

## **Challenges and Findings**  
1. **Reasoning and Context**:  
   Advanced models often struggle with contextual understanding and reasoning beyond annotated datasets.  

2. **Multilingual and Low-Resource Adaptability**:  
   Current datasets lack sufficient coverage for low-resource languages, limiting scalability.  

3. **Applications**:  
   Promising cross-lingual and domain-specific studies face cultural and contextual challenges.
